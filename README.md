# Experimenting with Splunk & Sysmon

## Objective

The Experimenting with Splunk & Sysmon project is where I will be documenting the process of installing both Splunk and Sysmon into the home lab environment created in my previous project. My hope is to better my understanding of the functions of a SIEM and to view/explore telemetry created by a malware attack.
